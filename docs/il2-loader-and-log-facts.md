# IL-2 loader and mission-log facts

Facts about the game that are not obvious from this repo's code. Each one cost at least one flight attempt to learn (2026-09-28 to 2026-10-07). Add to this list when a new one is found.

## Loading a mission or group

- **The loader rejects the whole file, with an empty error box,** if a quoted value holds `;` `=` `{` `}` `'` or any non-ASCII character. This applies to the editor and to `MissionResaver.exe`. Guard test: `probe_strings_are_loader_safe`.
- **Blocks must match the shipped shapes:** small LC ids, objective `LCName` and `LCDesc`, the shipped key order, no Group `XPos`. Guard test: `probe_blocks_match_shipped_shapes`.
- **`MissionResaver.exe` reproduces editor load errors without the editor.** It is in `C:\Program Files\IL2Series\game\bin\resaver`. Use it to test any generated file.
- **Build probes with `tools/p14/build_probe_mission.py`.** It resaves and checks the result, and deletes old outputs first, because the resaver keeps stale language files.
- **`K14 AFB_mp.Group` has no `Planes` list.** Pass `--spawn-planes` to the builder to add spawn planes.

## Language tables

- **A client or server can show a stale language table** from an earlier build with the same mission name. Give every build a new mission file name, or clear the old `.eng` and other language files on both server and client.
- **A new subtitle replaces the one on screen.** Long cues get cut off by the next one.

## The text mission log

- Turn it on with `mission_text_log` under `[KEY = system]` in `startup.cfg`. Logs are written to `data\logs\txt\`, a new file about every 33 s.
- **Log clock:** tick = 3 + 50 per second of mission time.
- **`OBJID` is not the MCU index.** Match objectives by position, which is exact.
- A Mission Objective with Success 1 **ends a dogfight round** about 8 s later. Success 0 logs `AType:8` and the round continues.
- Spawned-and-deleted vehicles write no log line.
- One MCU firing twice in the same tick logs one line.

## Mission logic

- **AI aircraft trigger check zones.** The coalition filter still works. See `docs/decisions/0008-ai-aircraft-trigger-check-zones.md`.
- An empty "Closer 0" zone does not fire on Activate plus a pulse.
- A pulse into an inactive relay is dropped, not replayed when the relay is activated.
- Deactivating a running timer cancels it. Re-triggering a running timer restarts it.
- Inputs to an inactive counter are not counted; the count survives Deactivate and Activate.
