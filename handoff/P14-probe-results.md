# P14 probe results

Step 0 "0d": one row per cell, observed vs the plan's "Confirmed if" column
(`handoff/P14-air-tasking.md` §8 step 0). Evidence is the server's text log,
read with `il2_mission_utility replay` (report: `handoff/P14-probe-replay.md`).

## Flight 0 — 2026-10-03, session `2026-10-03_20-45-36`

Korea dogfight on the user's dedicated server, built with
`tools/p14/build_probe_mission.py` from `claude/p14-air-tasking` @ `c87f492`
(breadcrumbs: C0/S0 objectives). Logs: `src/testdata/missionlog/real_3/`
(files `[1]`–`[118]`; `[0]`, the first ~30 s, was not supplied). The player
joined at 03:51 and spawned at Kimpo at 04:12 (F-80C); the mission was not
ended normally (no `AType:7`). No video.

Clock: the replay fits **T = 3 + 50·s** from 11 cue breadcrumbs (t4 confirmed).
All times below are mission time from Mission Begin.

| Cell | Observed (log) | Confirmed if | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| T-a1 | **ZA1** (Closer 1, `[2]`, 12 km, 60 km E of K14) fired at **01:57.40**; the player was not in a plane until 04:12, so the 4-ship AI F-80 flight crossing the zone set it off. ZA2 (`[1]`, control) never fired. | ZA1 silent until 06:00 | **a NOT confirmed: AI aircraft trigger a check zone.** (ZA4 / flight 1A still to fly.) |
| T-e E1 | fired once, 01:04 (3rd pulse); "E1 2+" never | fires on 3rd, no "2+" | confirmed |
| T-e E2 | fired 01:04 and 01:10; "E2 2+" at 01:10 (6th pulse) | 3rd, and "2+" at 6th | confirmed (Dropcount 1 resets) |
| T-e E3 | fired 01:06 (2 pulses, Deactivate, Activate, 1 pulse) | recorded | count survives Deactivate/Activate |
| T-e E4 | never fired | does not fire on 3rd (reset worked) | confirmed |
| T-e E5 | never fired (2 pulses while deactivated, Activate, 1 pulse) | recorded | inputs to an inactive counter are not counted |
| T-e E6 | fired 01:04 and 01:10; "E6 2+" at 01:10 | "2+" at the 6th pulse | confirmed (SetVal re-arms a fired counter) |
| T-e E7 | fired 01:40 | fires at 01:40 | confirmed: same-tick pulses counted one by one (r) |
| T-e E8 | fired 01:50; "E8 2+" never | shows, "2+" never | confirmed: once-gate works |
| T-e E9 | fired 02:00.10 | fires at 02:00.10 | confirmed |
| T-f F1 | 19 hits; "reached 12" at 03:39; "reached 29" never | 12–28 hits | confirmed |
| T-f F2 | outputs 1/2/3/4: 9 / 10 / 12 / 9 | each ≥ 1 | confirmed |
| T-t T1 | one line, 04:35 | exactly one | confirmed |
| T-t T2 | five lines, 04:37–04:45, 2 s apart | 5 lines | **confirmed: every firing logs (t1)** |
| T-t T3 | T3a and T3b both at 04:47 | both logged | confirmed (t5) |
| T-t T5 | no line (Spawn carrier) | information | as expected: spawned vehicles write nothing |
| T-t T7 | **one** line at 05:25 for one breadcrumb pulsed twice in a tick | 2 lines = log shows same-tick doubles | one line: the log cannot show a same-tick double firing of one MCU |
| T-j J1 | never fired (10 s timer deactivated at 5 s) | either | **cancels** (deactivating a running timer stops it) |
| T-j J2 | never fired (pulse into an inactive relay, Activate 1 s later) | no replay | **confirmed (j): no replay** |
| T-j J3 | never fired (Activate + pulse in one tick) | recorded | the same-tick pulse is dropped |
| T-j J4 | "J4 out" 09:00; "J4 out 2+" never | out once, no "2+" | **confirmed (q)**; valid because E7 is confirmed (0d rule) |
| T-j J5 | "J5 out" at 09:15 = 15 s after the first trigger; "2+" never | restart / ignore / twice | **restart (p)** |
| T-z Z1 | never fired, neither at 10:00 nor 10:15 | fires within 1 s, both times | **z NOT confirmed: an empty Closer 0 zone does not fire on Activate + pulse** |
| t2 | `OBJID` ≠ MCU index; position exact | — | match objectives by position |
| t3 | Success 0 logs, round continues; Success 1 ends the round (8.1 s) | — | C0/S0 is the default; visibility to players **not yet reported** |
| t6 | 30 cue/cell breadcrumbs logged; `[0]` missing, so CUE 01 and early T-a1 lines unseen | every subtitle has a line | partial (no video) |

## Strategy defaults set by flight 0 (0d table)

| Result | Setting |
|---|---|
| e (E1, E2, E4) | `BudgetImpl::HeadCount` |
| E6 | `CounterResetImpl::SetVal` |
| r (E7), E9 | `CensusImpl::Spaced` stays the default; `SameTick` may be chosen |
| f | `RandomImpl::InMission` |
| j (J2), J1 | D11 as written; deactivating a running timer cancels it |
| p (J5) | restart; `ZoneOutImpl::Watchdog` allowed |
| q (J4, via E7) | relay latches as written |
| t1–t6 | `TraceCarrier::Objective(C0/S0)`, tick rate 50/s, offset 3 |
| a (flight 0 part) | **AI counts.** Per the 0d table the D30 warning becomes an error unless the user decides otherwise (§10 item 15). Flight 1A's ZA4 still to fly. |
| z | not confirmed: `PresenceCheckImpl::Closer0Race` is **not** available as a fallback for c. |

**Gate G0: passed.** No "build stops" row fired (J2 confirmed; J4 confirmed with E7).

Walker defaults to align with the game: `DeactivateRunningTimer::Cancels` (J1),
`TimerRetrigger::Restart` (J5), `SameTickCounts::Each` (E7),
`DropcountMeaning::ResetOn1` (E2), `SetValRefires::Yes` (E6).
